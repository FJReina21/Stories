quest.name,The Wilsons' Legacy (Part II)
quest.description,This is the second part of the trilogy of The Wilson Family series. The first one is named Demons among the Wilson. So please, if you didn't play part I, I suggest you do it before playing this one. If you did play it, you can keep on reading this text: since there were a few possible endings in part I, I must clarify that the story in part II happens under the assumption that you stopped Valeria on time, and also recruited Noah after learning he wasn't a Wilson, but a Robinson.

Besides, each mode has its own special feature.\n\n<i>Sneaking in among the guests implies a standard difficulty, whereas sneaking in with magic could be a bit more challenging. That being said, if it's your first time, I'd recommend that you sneak in among the guests.</i>

UI16.uitext,EPILOGUE\n\nShortly after defeating Hannibal, you resolve to go find Noah, but you don't succeed. You only find spilt blood, so you decide to have it tested. You don't know whether he lives or not, nor where Tommy is... This looks really bad.\n\nThe DNA tests results reveal that the blood is, indeed, from Noah Robinson, since it matches Hannibal's. However, the police rule out the possibility that he's dead, based on two reasons: first, the amount of blood isn't enough to evidence he bled to death; and second, Tommy and his cult needed Hannibal's power, so, with him gone, they could use his son Noah. You'll have to find a way to stop him before it's too late...\n\n<i>Author's note: Congratulations! You managed to win this scenario. If you got all the clues before entering the lounge, you might want to try the other mode, with its own tiles and its unique feature. If you didn't, I encourage you to do so, since that will help you understand better the plot.</i>\n\n\n\n\n
