quest.name,Demons among the Wilson
quest.description,The Wilsons, a respectable family of wizards, are in danger. Isobel, one of the children of Daphne and Aiden Wilson, writes to you asking for your help. It seems that, after the death of her father and her moving out (along with his brother, Noah), Daphne has lost her mind. The youngest of her children, Valeria, wrote a letter to Isobel, warning her that her mother was up to something dangerous, and asked her for assistance. When Isobel read this letter, she made contact with you, given your reputation. You travel to the Wilson mansion with a double goal: to find Valeria before something bad happens to her, and to find out what Daphne's trying to do and stop her.
